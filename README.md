For this project, I wanted to create a web application that calculates how many calories a user should eat to loose, maintain, or gain weight.

At first, this was written in PHP. Then I decided to create a video player for videos that I made which showed users how to do the workouts.

 I hope that you enjoy playing around with the site just as much as I enjoyed building it.
